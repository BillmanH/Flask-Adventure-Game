## Flask RPG game.

I've always wantet to make an RPG as a hobby, this is my web-app RPG built entirely from vi on a Linux EC2 instance. The core technologies are FLASK and d3.js. The system is made to be as light as possible, extensible and flexible. I'm focusing more on the architecture and structure of the game, rather than the content so playing the game might seem a little 'dry'. I'll add more creative material when the backend is a little more developed. 

I built all of the tools to build worlds, characters and everything else out of Jupyter Notebooks. This way I can control the entire thing from a command line (like a chromebook or a rasbery pi). Very lightweight.
